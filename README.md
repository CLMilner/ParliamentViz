# ParliamentViz
First Python programme for scraping data on MPs and visualising.
Was inspired to create a project after completing some courses on Python and thought I'd try my own.
I started by searching for a single MP and committing to database. Now I've sourced the list, it goes through the names automatically.
I wanted to create a visualisation of the data and this is basic for the time being.
My plan is to expand and develop the progamme into something more useful! :-)
